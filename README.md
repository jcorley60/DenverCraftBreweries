## Background:

Colorado prides itself on the number of craft breweries that have opened within the state only recently within the last decade. A former Colorado Governor is even a co-founder of the well-known Wynkoop Brewery located in Denver. Golden, the first territorial capitol and a part of the greater Denver Metro Area, has been the home of the monolithic Coors Brewery since its inception in 1873.
